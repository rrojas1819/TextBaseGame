# TextBaseGame

Have a player that can choose 3 classes, and fight 3 enemies.

If die you restart completely(THIS ONE FIRST) or start where you left off? (Start where you left off would allow a stack 
(Maybe a secret item for second life?))

Game logic should run in a function that determines if the player has died, if they did check for second life, otherwise
DIEE
